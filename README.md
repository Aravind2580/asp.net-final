A Digital Library System is highly useful because it offers 24/7 access to a vast range
of books from anywhere, enhancing convenience and accessibility. It features 
automated lending and returning, personalized recommendations, and interactive 
reading options, providing a superior reading experience. Additionally, it reduces 
costs, supports environmental sustainability, and ensures secure, long-term 
preservation of digital books. This system streamlines book management and helps 
libraries better understand and serve their users through data and analytics.
